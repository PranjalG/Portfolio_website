          It was a breezy morning when I visited the Singh's abode. Lavanya was
          helping her mother to serve breakfast. Her face had lost colour since
          we last met. I had never experienced such a quiet and grave Lavanya,
          although I've always wanted her to grow up an act wise like adults but
          I could not have imagined that my expectation would become unbearable
          for me. She walked towards the balcony after washing the dishes I
          followed her and confronted her to share what is missing her up. She
          fabricated a smile and said, "Akhil, I'm fine." and then looked at her
          mother peeping through a distance. I could sense that she was unable
          to let her emotions out in front of a parents so I asked her, "Meet me
          alone in the society park, just like the old times when we let out our
          fears, thoughts, and opinions to one another without a second
          thought." She said nothing and began to gaze at the floor. I snapped
          my fingers in front of a face and she started for a moment and then
          said, "Yes,Yes, I will.." I nodded and left for my house. It was dusk
          and the sun was extending a citrine tinge over the lofty trees all
          across the park. Lavanya had arrived after 8 missed calls. She was
          wearing a grey skirt and denim jacket and like a previous meets here
          when she used to adorn herself with vivid colours, patterns and
          dangling accessories. She sat adjacent to me analyzing the grass for a
          few minutes and biting her lips. I initiated the grim conversation,
          "Lavanya, your mom is worried about your behaviour. Your voice tone
          has become gloomy, you haven't met any of your friends since months
          and you always look like your thinking. What are you thinking? Why do
          you look messed up? Are you depressed about something? Something or
          anything, feel free to share your despair with me."
          <br />
          She sighed, " Look Akhil, I-a-a- I don't know what to say, and how to
          say. I can't figure out how to deal with what I am feeling right now."
          <br />
          " Just say what are you depressed about."
          <br />
          " I feel,I feel guilty"
          <br />
          " About what? "
          <br />
          " About a mishap, I-a-I could've have stopped it." " Stopped what?"
          <br />
          " A death"
          <br />
          " What??"
          <br />
          I was dumbstruck.What could have my artless Lavanya done?
          <br />
          " It's a long story. You might not understand what I am going
          through."
          <br />
          " I will try my best to empathize with u. You look so much depressed.
          Calm down, and try to let go of your anguish."
          <br />
          " I can't..... I can't stop thinking about my mistake."
          <br />
          " Tell me about it."
          <br />
          " I can't get the story straight out of my mind.... There, there was,
          a girl, a juvenile,innocent,childish, naive, immature, 13 year old
          little girl, Komal."
          <br />
          " Why are you describing her so much?"
          <br />
          "Because she is the victim of my malicious deeds."
          <br />
          " What happened to her?"
          <br />
          " She hanged herself....a few weeks later."
          <br />
          " You know why?" " Not completely.... But I know one thing for sure, I
          am one of the reasons why she had to commit suicide."
          <br />
          " No Lavanya, I know you have a golden heart, you can not hurt an
          little innocent girl."
          <br />
          " But I did..... I killed her!! and I am a sinner."
          <br />
          Tears started to pave their way out of her regretful eyes.
          <br />
          " Lavanya hold on, explain me properly what did you do."
          <br />
          " I can't...Not right now."
          <br />
          She breathed heavily, drinking down her own tears.
          <br />
          " Please Lavanya, try to let your heart out. It will make you feel
          better."
          <br />
          " Nothing I do can bring back her and nothing you can do to make me
          feel better. Nothing is left for me to feel better about. Two lives
          have been sacrificed because of me."
          <br />
          " Two?"
          <br />
          " I have to go home...my mom is waiting."
          <br />
          " You will come tomorrow and tell me everything."
          <br />
          " I don't know...I can't..."
          <br />
          " Please Lavanya...let me help you."
