          When was the last time you visited the peri-urban areas of your city?
          Was it when you went out to spend some leisure time with your family
          and friends? Or was it when you wanted to yourself to be lost amidst
          the greens?

          The outskirts of maximum cities are sparsely populated. Some have
          town-like establishments, some contain factories and educational
          institutes, others are blessed with architectural or God-made wonders.
          When the city outskirts possess beautiful landscapes, like those of
          Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, people tend to swing in with their
          loved ones to enjoy quality time in the lap of nature. Large cliffs
          and gorges give an aesthetical imprint on our minds and these regions
          are frequented by youth mostly. We make cherishing memories at such
          places. But have you ever wondered what else fascinating and
          intriguing experiences await your presence?

          It was just a regular March evening, while travelling from Udaipur to
          Kota on the highway, I found a beautiful Golden Retriever with a
          collar around. It was wandering about the small vendors, searching and
          sniffing food. It was a domestic one, evident through the collar. I
          picked it up and took it along with me to Kota. I found the dog was
          ill, he was suffering from some communicable skin infection. Most
          probably, his disease was the reason for his owner to leave him alone
          in the outskirts. In India, you will find a Golden Retriever for
          around 10000-20000 as the internet suggests, but I found this Golden
          Treasure for free. I spent some amount of money for the treatment and
          today he is fit-n-fine. I have found a great companion in him and he
          scales down my loneliness to a large extent.
          <br />
          Recently, I read an article about spotting a Leopard in the outskirts
          of Hyderabad, Chilkur forest area. People would have been amazed at
          the sight of such an animal. Although fear arises, but we Indians are
          scarred of nothing. People pay to get to see these animals, but we are
          blessed to have their glimpse for free. Populace of outskirts suffer a
          number of problems. The people living around the cities face scarcity
          of water supply and electricity. They live in their own world where
          Google does not exist. They dwell in cottages made up of mud devoid of
          modern amenities. But these human beings are happier in their own
          world than any other city-resident. They portray true emotions that
          are long forgotten in our rat-race lives. Meeting them and spending
          few minutes with them has always made my highway drives a memorable
          experience. Life happens out of your comfort zone. Pack your
          necessities and travel to your nearest outskirts to find un-expected
          paths. Fall into the lap of nature or embrace the village-men, talk to
          those small vendors rather asking for directions, leave a trail behind
          and find new roads, explore yourself. Life is nothing but a daring
          adventure.
