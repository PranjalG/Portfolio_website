          Resilience is an ineffable quality that makes people face difficult
          situations of life and come out stronger. It is the process of
          adapting well in the time of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or
          even significant sources of stress — such as family and relationship
          problems, serious health problems, or workplace and financial
          stressors. It means “bouncing back” from difficult experiences.
          <br />
          It takes courage to persevere and thrive in the face of exposure to
          adverse situations. We can't deal with hardships with a soft heart.
          One needs to develop calmness and the ability to process mentally and
          physically all problems in their darkest colour. There is a saying,
          'better said than done' which means it is very easy to cite big words,
          deep thoughts and impossible dreams but to make them reality and to
          apply those words, thoughts and dreams in real life, is not a cup of
          tea.
          <br />
          The urge to never give up and never quit plays an important role and
          one needs to become brave and resilient towards the highs and lows of
          the cycle of life. This cycle keeps on moving and never stops for
          anyone, even if there is a loss of a loved one, a close family member
          or your own descendant. When such despair strucks, we feel like giving
          up on life, giving up on every kind of hope because at that time we
          feel that God is being harsh upon us. But as they say, time heals
          everything and leaves us with a rock-strong heart with which we fear
          no adversity and are able to suffer destruction because what we
          consider painful and agonising is far beyond the level of pain and
          agony this harsh world can give. Yes, it is hard to live with pain
          residing deep inside thick walls of your heart but with such an
          indestructible heart, we can test ourselves in the most challenging
          situations ever and present our best strongest self in front of the
          world. Instead of falling into despair or hiding from problems with
          unhealthy coping strategies, resilient people face life's difficulties
          head-on. This does not mean that they experience less distress, grief,
          or anxiety than other people do. It means that they use healthy coping
          skills to handle such difficulties in ways that foster strength and
          growth. In many cases, they may emerge even stronger than they were
          before. Those who lack this resilience may instead become overwhelmed
          by such experiences. They may dwell on problems and use unhelpful
          coping mechanisms to deal with life’s challenges. Disappointment or
          failure might drive them to unhealthy, destructive, or even dangerous
          behaviors. These individuals are slower to recover from setbacks and
          may experience more psychological distress as a result.
          <br />
          Resilience helps us consider how we might adapt our service to
          individual needs and develop solutions to problems. Social skills play
          an important role in a Social Care Worker career. If you are well
          prepared you can improve your self-confidence and communication skills
          enabling you to feel stronger and more comfortable. Mind and body
          needs to be well equipped to deal with uncomfortable or challenging
          situations. Positive self-affirmations enhance positive thinking and
          self-respect. This will not only affect your psyche positively, but
          also, through repetition it will raise your awareness of it. But
          resilience has a dark side too. Extreme resilience could drive people
          to become overly persistent with unattainable goals. Although we tend
          to celebrate individuals who aim high or dream big, it is usually more
          effective to adjust one’s goals to more achievable levels, which means
          giving up on others.In addition, too much resilience can get in the
          way of leadership effectiveness and, by extension, team and
          organizational effectiveness. Resilience is a useful and highly
          adaptive trait, especially in the face of traumatic events. However,
          when taken too far, it may focus individuals on impossible goals and
          make them unnecessarily tolerant of unpleasant or counterproductive
          circumstances.
