          "If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and
          become more, you are a leader."
          <br />
          I would define leadership as the ability to initiate, to process and
          work coherently on innovative ideas. Leadership is exhibited by how we
          influence others, what impact we create on society, how our actions
          depict our ultimate goal and the methodology adopted to gain support
          from our fellows.There are many ways we are having an effect on the
          members of the different communities we are a part of.
          <br />
          I am pursuing my bachelor's degree from a reputed government college.
          There exists a robotics club which provides an environment where all
          students build bots and compete among themselves but I didn't find a
          proper lab for such activities. I approached the club coordinators and
          they introduced me to e-Yantra IITB, which is a flagship project under
          MHRD India through the National Mission on Education through ICT
          (NMEICT).The prime purpose of which is to spread Embedded Systems and
          Robotics education in colleges across India. I gathered more
          information about events organised by e-Yantra at IITB and came to
          know about eLSI (e-Yantra Lab Setup Initiative).
          <br />
          This was a turning point when I desired to have a fully-equipped
          robotics lab in our college. I attended the webinars conducted by
          e-Yantra for almost a month and participated in the robotics
          competition also to hone my skills. I worked with three of my fellow
          classmates and crossed Stage 1 of the competition. But our team lagged
          behind because we had no proper laboratory for testing our bots, due
          to which we couldn't cross Stage 2. I decided to work upon this issue
          and wrote an email to the e-Yantra support organization and they
          responded positively. But no man can move a mountain alone, I can't
          build a lab on my own. But I wanted to initiate the process so that it
          would build a culture and proper direction could be given to our
          college students to work upon their skills of embedded systems and
          bot-building.
          <br />
          I approached the Computer Science Department faculties to bring this
          issue in their eyes and they agreed to support. It was ultimately
          beneficial of all the students of the college. The college authorities
          contacted e-Yantra for information regarding establishment eligibility
          and complete procedure. The e-Yantra team guides establishment of
          Robotics Lab in an effective manner by training teams of four(4)
          teachers and ten(10) students from the college itself. They organized
          an aptitude test for selection of candidates. I contacted the robotics
          club coordinators but they tried to postpone the process due to the
          worldwide pandemic. I didn't lose hope. I knew that my colleagues had
          immense inclination towards embedded systems and bot-building. I
          hosted webinars to make fellow students of my college aware of what my
          plans were for the establishment of a well equipped technical robotics
          lab in our college. I mustered support from over 100 students and they
          boosted my confidence. With the co-ordination of my teacher, I
          gathered funds from administration department and prepared a list of 4
          teachers and 50 students who were keen to appear on the aptitude test
          for robotics training. And now the funds are being generated by the
          institute for the whole lab setup.
          <br />
          This experience taught me that not even a worldwide pandemic can stop
          growth if we desire to build our own way out of the fire. There are
          miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before I sleep. I believe
          that a significant challenge that women face in the tech industry is
          the stereotype that women are inferior than men. Even today, women are
          paid less as compared to men for the same job. Women are growing in
          all aspects and proving their worth but the number of representatives
          is quite small when compared to men. Particularly in India, the
          stereotypes govern women perspective. From an early age, men are
          taught to be strong and independent but women are taught to be
          sensitive and dependent. These societal norms vanish when intellect
          enters our mind but still a trace of inferiority remains. We, as a
          responsible society need not to sympathize with women, but to treat
          them with equal opportunity and equal value for their work.

          <br />
          When I entered into engineering, my neighbours and peers started
          talking negative about me, and that I couldn't compete in a
          manly-sector. I forged metal, practiced carpentry, welded metal in my
          first year of college and didn't feel even an ounce of inferiority
          when compared to my male classmates. I learnt to code and worked on
          projects with male students and never felt that I lag behind being a
          female. I believe that we are confined to the walls built by
          ourselves. Women are equally as strong as men physically and mentally.
          It all begins within our home, when as kids, we learn that our mother
          cooks food and dad earns. Mother and kids are a liability and father
          is an asset to the nation. This is the scenario of almost all Indian
          houses. Parents spend most of their earning in their daughter's
          marriage instead of her career. Marriage and giving birth are
          important rituals in a female's life but they can't be considered the
          sole purpose of existence of a woman. Emphasizing on education and
          higher studies is very important. I believe there is a need to change
          the outlook. But it won't come over night. Time will take it's toll
          and many women like Kalpana Chawla, Neera Tandon, Kamla Harris,
          Nirmala Sitaraman, Reshma Saujani, Vinita Singh, etc. will continue to
          prove that nothing is impossible. A woman does not need empowerment.
          She needs equal opportunity and equal value of work. 'Teach girls
          bravery and not perfection' should be our motto.
